These shaders are placeholders, NOT functional shaders. Apply these shaders to your material and configure the material properties. When the asset bundles are compiled, these shaders will be exachanged for the real thing using SB3UGS scripts.

Do not add or remove properties from these shaders or shader replacement may not work properly.
